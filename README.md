# StatNotes

The following notes were written using Typora (https://typora.io/) with the inline mathjax setting activated.

Note that Chapter questions will not be correctly numbered if viewed using normal markdown. e.g. 1. 3. will look like 1. 2. in normal markdown.
Additional spacing before text on each line can also be seen in Typora but not in regular markdown.
