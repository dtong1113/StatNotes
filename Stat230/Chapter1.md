# 1. Introduction To Probability

## Summary
Defines topics about probability.

## 1.1 Definition of Probability

**Definition**: *Sample Space* - The set of all possible distinct outcumes to a random experiment

**Definition**: *Classical definition* - the probability of some event, provided that all events are equally likely, is $$\frac{\text{number of ways the event can occur}}{\text{number of outcomes in S}}$$
**Definition** : *Relative frequency definition* - the probability of an event is the proportion of times the event occurs in a very long series of repetitions of an experiment or process

**Definition**: *Subjective probability definition* - the probability of an event is a measure of how sure the person making the statement is that the event will happen

**Definition**: *Probability model*  - a sample space of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is defined; a set of events, subsets of the sample space to which we can assign probabilities, is defined; a mechanism for assigning probabilities (between 0 and 1) to events is specified
