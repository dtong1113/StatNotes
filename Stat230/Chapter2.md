# 2. Mathematical Probability Models

## Summary


## 2.1 Sample Spaces and Probability
**Definition**: *Experiment* - a phenomenon or process which is repeatable (in theory) with defined events or outcomes ($A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots$ )

**Definition**: *Trial* - a single repetition of an experiment

**Definition**: *Simple event* - an event that is indivisible so it contains only one points, e.g. $A_1 = \{ a_1\}$ 

**Definition**: *Compound event* - an event made up of two or more simple events, e.g. $A = \{a_1, a_2 \}$ 

Typically in notation we will commonly not distinguish between a point $a_1$ and the event $A_i = \{ a_i\}$ which has this point as a single element. Although they are different mathematical objects, $P(A_i)$ or $P(\{a_i\})$ is often shortened to $P(a_i)$. 

**Definition**: *Probability distribution* - the probability distribution on $S$ is the set of probabilities $\{ P(a_i), i = 1, 2, \ldots \}$

**Definition**: *Probability of an event* - the probability $P(A)$ of an event $A$ is the sum of the probabilities for all simple events that make up $A$ or $P(A) = \sum_{a \in A}P(a)$

1. a) The sample space is the (x, y) where x and y can be one of 4 math professors

   b) 1/4

2. a) (x, y, z) where $x, y, z \in \{0, 1\}$ 

   b) 3/8

   c) 1/4

3. a) $5 \choose 2$ combinations

   b) 1/10

   c) 2/5

6. a) 18/20

   b) 20/1000

   c) 18/78

7. a) Each event in the sample space refers to an instance where the Machine is trying to recognise a digit 

   b) $0.4 + 2*0.096 + 2*0.095 + 2*0.098 = 0.978$ 

9. (Challenge) Let n be Allen's number. If $n \leq 4$ pick $n+1$, if $n = 5$ pick 5, if $n \geq 6$ pick $n-1$
